# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



A React weather app is a web application built using the React.js library that allows users to check the weather forecast for different locations. It typically includes features such as displaying current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a multi-day forecast. The app may also offer additional functionalities like searching for weather by location, displaying weather alerts, and providing a visually appealing user interface.

The React weather app is built using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide weather data, such as OpenWeatherMap API or WeatherAPI. The app fetches data from these APIs and dynamically updates the UI to reflect the latest weather information for the selected location.

Key features of a React weather app may include:

Current Weather Display: Showing the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Forecast: Displaying a multi-day weather forecast, including highs, lows, and weather conditions for each day.
Search Functionality: Allowing users to search for weather information by location.
Responsive Design: Ensuring the app is mobile-friendly and works well on different devices.
Weather Alerts: Providing alerts for severe weather conditions or other weather-related warnings.
Location Detection: Automatically detecting the user's location to show local weather information.
Customization: Allowing users to customize the app's settings, such as units (e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit) and themes.
Overall, a React weather app provides a user-friendly way to access and visualize weather information, making it easier for users to plan their activities and stay informed about current and future weather conditions.
